# Cryptocurrencies

## The purpose of this project was to understand what unsupervised learning is used for, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce your dimensions and what goes on when you use PCA. Current challenge file shows reports of what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how cryptocurrencies could be grouped toward creating a classification for developing a new cryptocurrencies investment portfolio for its customers. The process involved preparing the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means, reducing data dimensions using PCA algorithms from sklearn, predicting clusters using cryptocurrencies data using the K-means algorithm form sklearn, and creating some plots and data tables to present results. Furthermore, the data visualizations depict the classifications of the cryptocurrencies.
